#Notes and Ideas
- what is the game that is haunted?
- what does the haunter want?
- is the player character a character or still the player? Is the game first person?
- is the game already a mystery?
- is the haunting revealed at the top or saved as the game end?
- what is haunted here; a game, a story, a computer file?
